# Predictive modelling in Agriculture

This project delved into the analysis of NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) levels and pH values across diverse soil samples, each associated with an ideal crop type. Leveraging advanced data science methodologies, including data preprocessing techniques and the evaluation of different classification models such as Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbours, and Decision Tree, a refined model emerged for predicting the most accurate type of crop given the NPK and pH values.

By integrating data science into agricultural practices, this project promotes informed decision-making, optimized crop selection, and ultimately, enhanced agricultural productivity. Through a cross-validation process for model performance comparison, the Decision Tree model emerged as the most accurate choice for this context.

Subsequently, employing this Tree-based model and conducting the corresponding testing and validation, an accuracy rate of 76.7% and an F1-score of 76.5% were achieved.
While these results demonstrate considerable success, avenues for further improvement exist. Enhancing feature engineering and preprocessing stages, along with exploring data augmentation, are among the strategies to pursue for even better performance.
